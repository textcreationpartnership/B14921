            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please your <hi>Maiesty,</hi> to call to your remembrance, how, that some twelue months since I presēted vnto You the Copy of these few lines following in approbation of Bowes &amp; Arrowes:</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:13458:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Bowes and Arrowes heretofore haue beene famous weapons of warre, both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue and defensiue against the enemies of these Kingdomes: and thereby victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous battels and famous conquests haue bin gotten, though now they are imployed to no vse but for Recreation and sport; but J by practice, with an Jnuention haue attained to this perfection, that a Souldier with his Corslet and Pike may vse his Long-Bow and Arrowes, with great agilitie, more force and aduantage against the Enemy, then euer heretofore, not hindring the vse of Gunnes or other weapons, nor incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the Pike or any martiall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which, vpon your Maiesties order giuen for the sight thereof, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it before you by a Souldier in your Maiesties Parke at <hi>S. Iames's:</hi> and after that, I petitioned vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
<pb facs="tcp:13458:3"/>that You would bee pleased to giue order that it might be practised in the two Schooles of <hi>martiall Discipline,</hi> the two <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> (vnto which two I gaue vnto each a Pike and a Bow placed vnto it, and a sheafe of Arrowes) and your Maiesties Answer vnto my Petition (as I was informed) was, That it were meeter for them to practise it of their owne accord. Vpon which Answer from your Maiesty, I solicited those Societies for the practice and exercise of the Bow with the Pike: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that worthy Societie in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery Garden</hi> in <hi>London</hi> hath practised it euer since. But because many of that worthy Society haue not heretofore exercised shooting, it doth not take that perfection as yet, which I hope time and practice will bring it vnto:
<pb facs="tcp:13458:4"/>for it is the exercise of shooting that must make men perfect therein: so that if Statute-Lawes were in force for the exercise of Shooting, as in former times they haue beene, then would this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of mine be perfitted, and the Brittish Bowmen grow famous againe as in former ages they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Most Gratious Soueraigne:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue endeuored my selfe vnto the vtmost of my small abilitie, for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of this Exercise, and spent my time and meanes for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of my desires therin: which is, to make those worthy Societies perfect therein, and so generally throughout the Land: &amp; hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supportation, nor countenance, from any (but God alone) I cannot wholly imploy my selfe thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing constrained for the maintenance of
<pb facs="tcp:13458:4"/>my poore estate and family, to wrestle in the world, neyther haue I literature sufficient, for illustration of so worthy a thing, as is this Inuention, if it were perfect: yet that it may not die in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion, I haue here presented vnto your Maiesty this vnpolished Discourse, shewing herein the antiquitie of the Bow, with part of the famous exploits which were atchieued by the seruice of our Brittish Bowmen, &amp; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths good in the time of the vse thereof. Also, some directions for the practice of the Pike and Bow in Rankes and Fyles, by this Inuention; with some Portraitures of the proper postures belonging thereunto, and the proper words of command for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof: Humbly beseeching your sacred Maiestie, not to reiect it for the rudenesse thereof, for although
<pb facs="tcp:13458:5"/>the tongue be faultering like <hi>Moses,</hi> and the hand be rough like <hi>Esawes,</hi> yet the heart is perfect and constant like <hi>Hushai</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid:</hi> Vouchsafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gracious Soueraigne, to grace it with your gracious acceptance; and if it grow to perfection, let God haue the honor, your Soueraigne Maiestie the patronage, and this Common-wealth the benefit.</p>

Thirdly, wee doe hereby double seruice, both with the Pike and with the Bow also, whereas without the Bow, the pikeman stands but as a marke for the muskettiers and horsemen, as is explained in the booke formerly named.</p>

            <p>As he did vnto <hi>Noah</hi> when he built the Arke, whereby both hee and his family were preserued from the Flood.</p>
            <p>At which time also, the Lord made his Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, for their comfort, and set his Bow in the Cloud for confirmation thereof: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it pleased God to inspire into man such wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and policy, to imitate and make materiall Bowes, for their vse and defence, against the wilde beasts of the field, which otherwise might haue deuoured them: and likewise when enuie and strife grew betwixt man and man, it serued for a chiefe weapon amongst them, to maintaine their rights, and to defend themselues one against the other, &amp; so
<pb facs="tcp:13458:11"/>by vse the Bow became the best weapon of all others vnto succeeding ages.</p>
            <p>And after this began the name of Archer; for it is said of <hi>Ismael,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God was with him, and he dwelt in the wildernesse, and was an Archer.</p>
            <p>So likewise were the two sonnes of <hi>Izhac,</hi> for <hi>Esau</hi> was an Archer, and he vsed his Bow for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iacob</hi> vsed it for Warres, for hee saith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his sonne <hi>Ioseph,</hi> I haue giuen thee one porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ground, which I got from the Amorite with my Sword, and with my Bow.</p>
            <p>And so successiuely it was vsed amongst the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, and of great estimation, for King <hi>Dauid</hi> he saith, that the Lord he teacheth the vse thereof, and likewise inableth a man therevnto in these words, The Lord, saith he, teacheth my hands to Warre, so that a Bow of Steele is broken by mee: and all King <hi>Dauids</hi> Worthies and chiefe men of Ware, were armed with Bowes and Arrowes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>David</hi> also, hee commanded that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should be taught to shoot, &amp; to learne the vse of the Bow, &amp; so to succeeding ages it continued, and was accounted of amongst all the famous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, to be the best Weapon.</p>
            <p>It is recorded in holy Writ, that the Assyrians they vsed the Bow and Arrowes, in all their warres against the Israelites.</p>
            <p>The Persians; their Kings were admirable Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:13458:11"/>and they accounted of it as their best weapon for warres, and still it is in vse with them.</p>
            <p>And likewise the Romanes in all their conquests, they esteemed of the Bowmen to bee the best and surest souldiers.</p>
            <p>The Parthians with their Bowes and Arrowes, vanquished the famous Romane Captaine, <hi>Crassus,</hi> with all his Legions (which came into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to conquer it) and slew them all.</p>
            <p>The Turkes, they haue vsed this weapon in all their conquests, and doe still vse it, so that by their continuall vse and perfect skill therein, together with their innumerable multitude of Arrowes fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the sight of their enemies, when they goe to warres, they are a terrour vnto all their Christian neighbours that inhabit about them, and what King or Potentate is of that force and power, as is the Turke now at this day.</p>
            <p>But of all the Nations in the world, our Brittish Nation were most excellent and famous, in this weapon the long Bow and Arrowes, before wee were so variable in neglecting the vse thereof.</p>
            <p>And certainly, if we of all other Nations, being so expert in the vse thereof; and also by agilitie so inabled, I say if we had exercised and vsed the long Bow and Arrowes in the Warres, as heretofore our Predecessors haue done, we had been famous thereby as they were.</p>
            <p>For then our Brittish Nation were accounted the absolute best warriours in the world, and got
<pb facs="tcp:13458:12"/>by the vse of the Bow, victorious battailes, and conquests, to their immortall fame and honour, as in our Chronicle-Histories it is recorded, whereof I will set downe some few, omitting many more for brevitie.</p>
            <p>I will first begin with King <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for he conquered this Land by the vse of the Bow, as is recorded by Sr <hi>Iohn Haward,</hi> in his book of the History of the three first <hi>Norman</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>Also King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, who hauing title to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> inuaded it, and in a set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at <hi>Cresse,</hi> he subdued the French, so that most of the Nobilitie were either slain, or taken; and also conquered the strong towne of <hi>Callis,</hi> all which was accomplished by the seruice of the Bowmen.</p>
            <p>After that, his sonne the famous Prince <hi>Edward</hi> called the Blacke Prince, hee in a set battell at <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> tooke the French King prisoner, and withall most of the Nobilitie were either slaine or taken: and all these battels and Victories were gotten by the Bowmens seruice.</p>
            <p>So likewise King <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, in the battaile at <hi>Agincourt,</hi> obtained a glorious Victory: In which battaile, as the story saith, were taken and slaine, the flower of all the Nobilitie of <hi>France,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the vnequalitie of the number in all these battels, for it is Recorded, that the French excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Brittons in number ten for one, and this was atchieued by the seruice of the Bowmen.</p>
            <p>After this, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt,
<pb facs="tcp:13458:12"/>what famous battels were gotten vnder the leading of the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> then Regent in <hi>France,</hi> by his valiant Bowmen.</p>
            <p>I will forbeare to speake of the ciuill Warres here in our owne Land, for they were vnnaturall warres, therefore let them die in obliuion.</p>
            <p>But after this, King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth made a iourney into France with his Bowmen, where hee obtained of the French King, a Peace according to his desire.</p>
            <p>Likewise when King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh came in against <hi>Richard</hi> the murderous vsurper, &amp; subdued him: in all which Warres, the Bow and Arrowes were altogether their chiefest and best weapons.</p>
            <p>And likewise King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, when hee made his journeys into France, &amp; like a conqueror won the Cities of <hi>Turwin,</hi> and of <hi>Tourney,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward of <hi>Bullen;</hi> in all which journeys, hee was furnished with his valiant Bowmen, which still were a terrour vnto their enemies, the showers of Arrowes which they shot, did euen darken the skies, and did so amaze the enemy, that the very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof, was as grieuous vnto them, as death it selfe, for they are vnauoidable, as did appeare by the many wounds which they gaue vnto all either horse, or foot, for no part of the body, the very eye is not free from the Arrow.</p>
            <p>And this is certaine, that if either man or horse be wounded with a sheafe Arrow, with a Barb'd head thereon, let it be in what part of the body so euer,
<pb facs="tcp:13458:13"/>if it doth not deadly execution, it makes him vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing any seruice, for either they must pull out the Arrow, and so mortifie and rend the flesh, veynes, &amp; sinews, and sometimes in so pulling of the Arrow out, to leaue the head behind, or else cut out the piece, in what place so euer it sticketh.</p>
            <p>But especially for horse it is acknowledged by all Commanders, that it is the absolute best weapon of all others, for no horse will endure the hurt of an Arrow, but with the smart thereof hee will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order all those about him, and both spoile himselfe and his Rider.</p>
            <p>But now, by new Inuentions and Stratagems, the old Militarie discipline in the Warres is altered; and therefore the Bow is cast by as altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruiceable in these times.</p>
            <p>True it is, that many are the Inuentions of man, and haue been from the beginning, some good and well-pleasing to God, and some againe wicked and offensiue both to God, and all good men.</p>
            <p>Amongst all which, <hi>Bartholdus Swart</hi> the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan Fryer, with his most diuellish Inuention of Gunpowder, is the most damnable, and from hell it selfe inuented.</p>
            <p>But it is now of that estimation, that many other both Inuentions and Weapons, formerly in great account, are quite laid aside as altogether vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, especially with vs, this ancient famous wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, the Bow and Arrowes is quite extinguished.</p>
            <p>Other Nations notwithstanding they make vse
<pb facs="tcp:13458:13"/>of new Inuentions; yet doe they not leaue off these famous ancient Weapons the Bow and Arrowes, as we haue done these many yeares.</p>
            <p>And because now in these later variable times, since these sulphurious Inuentions haue beene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and thereby the vse of Hand-guns and Muskets haue been in request, the Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes haue been altogether neglected by our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is aforesaid, because they are thought to be vneffectuall, and not of force to do that execution which the fiery weapons doe.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding, if the Premises before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of be well considered, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the number of Arrowes still flying, (for euery Archer may shoot sixe Arrowes within the time of the charging, and discharging of one Musket) and the number of Bowmen stil shooting, (for how many so euer they be, they may all shoot together) also the many wounds which the Arrowes doe giue, (for few of them fly in vaine amongst a multitude) together with the terrour of the Obiect, and sight of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny voleys of Arrowes still flying vpon the enemy: It cannot bee denied but it must needs disorder them, whether they be horse or foot.</p>
            <p>Besides, in the raine or moist weather, the Bow and Arrowes are seruiceable, vpon all advantages, when the fiery weapons cannot be vsed.</p>
            <p>But there is an Obiection to bee made, that it would bee double charges to maintaine Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Warres, and the effects that may be
<pb facs="tcp:13458:14"/>done thereby, will not counteruaile it.</p>
            <p>Besides, to haue Bowmen with others in the Warres, according to the Martiall discipline now vsed,
<note place="margin">This obiection is answered by the chiefe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of this Discourse, which shewes that the Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man now is made a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man also by this new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</note> they would be troublesome vnto the rest, and cannot be placed to doe seruice, as in former times they haue done, by reason there are not in these times, set battailes fought in the field, as in former times haue been: and in those set battels the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were placed and barricadoed in, whereby the horsemen could not breake in vpon them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so conueniently placed, to shoot their voleys of Arrowes, thereby to gall and wound the horse, and therewithall to disorder them, and this is said to be the most materiall seruice that the Bowmen did.</p>
            <p>I will not now further dilate vpon the many good seruices, which the Bowmen haue done in former times, ancient Histories relate suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently thereof, as before I haue shewed. But it is apparent by Record, that it was a conquering weapon: for I finde in those battels formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, that the Bowmen did so wound &amp; anoy the enemy with Arrows, that they could neither fight nor fly, and that the English like conquerors, did kill and take prisoners whom they listed; so that euery English souldier had two, three, or foure prisoners; and I thinke I may say without offence, that it is a weapon well pleasing to God: But sure I am, it is the cheapest weapon of all others, and the easiest both to be had, and to be practised.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:13458:14"/>
            <p> Besides, it was a good Common-wealths handy Trade, and employed many thousands at worke, which liued well thereby; for in euery City and Towne in euery Shire throughout the Land, yea in euery Country Parish, there were of Bowyers, Fletchers, String-makers, and Arrow-head makers, or some others thereunto depending, that liued by their imployment therein. And for recreation and exercise it exceedeth all, it makes vs apt and fit to doe our Prince seruice vpon all sudden occasions, it encreaseth strength and agility, it maintaines health, and expels diseases, It procures a stomack, and causeth good digesture, and being moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed, the exercise thereof is maintained with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie small charges,</p>
            <p>Much more besides may be spoken of this lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Exercise of Shooting, for the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of expels drunkennesse, swearing, dicing, carding, quoyting, cat-playing, besides many other vaine and vngodly vices.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Sabbath day was not so prophaned when this exercise was vsed, for then the country Famers and Yeomen, with others likewise, with their sonnes and men seruants, notwithstanding they dwelt farre from their Parish Churches, yet would they take their Bowes and Arrowes for their recreation and exercise, and so shoot to their Parish Churches and goe to diuine Seruice, both morning and euening; whereas now, there are many that spend their time much worse vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:13458:15"/>Sabbath day, either in some of these vnlawfull games or vices before spoken of, or some others as bad, or else sitting in the Alehouse drinking, swearing, sucking Tobacco, and so spending their time and patrimony also, and scarce go to Church, especially to euening Prayer once in a quarter of a yeare.</p>
            <p>All these premises considered, (obliged mee) both for the honour of God, my bounden duty and allegiance vnto my gracious Soueraigne, with my naturall loue to my country, for the honour and preseruation of the same, both to study and practise how I might be seruiceable thereunto.</p>
            <p>And thereupon, being an Archer, I practised how to bring that famous ancient weapon, the Long-bow and Arrowes into the field againe, to doe seruice for my Prince and Country, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times they haue done.</p>
            <p>To this end and purpose I endeauored my selfe many yeares, practising with many inuentions, vntill at last it pleased God to perfect me therein: So that now I doe constantly affirme, not onely by my owne perfect experience and practice, but by the practice of the worthy Society of the traind Band, in the Artillerie Garden in <hi>London,</hi> it being practised there this twelue months, and approued of, not onely by that worthy Society, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient experienced Captaine thereof, Captaine <hi>Bingham;</hi> but by the approbation of many other honourable Commanders,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:13458:15"/>
            <p> That the Souldier with his Corslet and his Pike may be a Bowman also, with great ease and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with great strength and aduantage, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incumbrance, and therewith to encounter his enemy in the open field, with the Muskettiers and others; whereas without the Bow the Pikemen are but as a marke for the Muskettiers and Horsemen to play vpon, doing no seruice vntill they come to the push or charge.</p>
            <p>But now being armed with the Bow,
<note place="margin">The former Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> they are ready to come on vpon all aduantages, his Pike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his barricadoe, and with his Arrowes he shall offend his enemy from 18 or 20 score yards, vnto sixe score yards, as well as the Muskettiers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his enemy be horse or foot, vntill they come to close, which they will hardly do, as many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders doe verifie, if these weapons were well exercised and practised together, and men made perfect therein, according as is requisite in all other weapons.</p>
            <p>But some haue obiected, that the weight of the Bow and Arrowes will be too much for the Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to carie.</p>
            <p>But it is easily answered, for it is very probable, that the weight is of no moment, for the Bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fastned vnto the Pike in the place where they shoulder the Pike, it is thereby caried with great ease: And likewise the Pike is a Rest for the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme for drawing of his Bow, being made fast in the place aforesaid with the Engin; for he chargeth
<pb facs="tcp:13458:16"/>not his Bow-arme with any strength by drawing, but onely to guide his Arrow towards his marke, by which helpe, he may draw a Bow much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then otherwise he could doe.</p>
            <p>I reade also, that in former times when Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had continued long in the Field, by reason of their lying on the ground, or by some other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, that thereby they grew weake, so that they were not able to draw their Bowes.</p>
            <p>But now by this Inuention, with the helpe of the Pike, being a Rest for the Bow-arme, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, the Bowman is inabled to vse his Bow, and to shoot, notwithstanding these inconueniences.</p>
            <p>For it is probable, that any Archer may draw his Bow with his right arme, which is his drawing arme, when hee cannot beare it out with his left arme, which is his holding-out, or Bow-arme.</p>
            <p>I haue had conference with some Commanders, debating vpon seruices which may bee done with the Bow and Arrowes, and some are opinioned, that they wil be seruiceable for to shoot fire-works vpon some occasion; and I know by experience, that an Archer may shoot an ounce of fire-worke vpon an Arrow twelue score yards.</p>
            <p>But they all doe approue, that the Pikemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed with Bowes and Arrowes, according to this Inuention practised, they are thereby enabled to doe very materiall seruice, for the guard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyes, which for the most part are assaulted by the horse.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:13458:16"/>
            <p> And although now in these times, there are many stratagems vsed in the Warres, which in former times were not; yet notwithstanding I presume, that Bowes and Arrowes vsed by this Inuention, will be found very seruiceable many wayes as yet vndiscouered.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conclude, that by this Inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Bow man may performe that seruice many wayes, which in former times hee could not doe, being armed with his Corslet, and barrocadoed with his Pike, and thereby imboldened to come on, as is aforesaid, or if occasion be, vpon any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, he may take his Bow from his Pike, and so be a Bowman, or Pikeman alone.</p>
            <p>Now the perfection of this exercise if they haue been Bowmen, may be attained vnto by practice without any great difficultie, and thereby hee is a <hi>Double-Armed man:</hi> And for the order and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures belonging to the Pike and Bow, for the true vse thereof, is as followeth.</p>
            <p>First, the whole body of Pikes must keepe their fyles of Pikes straight by line, for in so doing they may all shoot, as well the middle and the Reare, as the Front, without offending one another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, euery follower must shoot right ouer his Leaders head, and so shoot thorow his own fyle of Pikes, for that must be his true direction to make his shoot.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the enemy comes on, and that the leaders doe shoot brest high, then are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="tcp:13458:17"/>to beare their Bowhand euen with the top of his leaders head, for that is the lowest and shortest distance, that they can shoot, standing in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and square body.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, after your last shoot, which is about sixescore yards, you must fasten your Bow, and come vp to your close order for the charge, and if it be for horse, while the fiue or sixe first Ranges stand charged with their Pikes, rested at the foot, and their Swords drawne, the middle &amp; the reare may shoot their voleys of Arrowes, and doe good seruice, whereas without their Bowes they can doe nothing, but stand with their Pikes sloapt, or ported</p>
            <p>These obseruations for the practice of this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, I haue here set downe for instruction vnto all those, that hereafter shall endeuour to practise the same.</p>
            <p>Here followeth the proper words of command, belonging to this exercise for the Pike and Bow, according as it hath beene practised by the worthy Societie in the Artilerie Garden in London.</p>

            <p>This Portraiture is most proper for the third place, for after shooting the first volley of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes at the furthest distance, If any fall short, you are ready being so ported, to march ten paces, or more or lesse, as you shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to shoot your second volley of arrowes; and then againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ported, you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to retire, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, to shoot the third volley of arrowes. &amp;c.</p>
